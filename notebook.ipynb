    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The business problem is the need to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes. We will use multiple linear regression to predict the edstimated value of homes in King County. By analyzing various features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage etc, we aim to provide homeowners with valuable insights on how specific home renovations may impact and value their properties.\n",
    "## Main Objective\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to develop a multiple linear regession model that accurately predicts the estimated value of homes in King County. By analyzing the relationships between various features and sale prices, the model will provide insights on how specific home renovations impact the estimated value. The ultimate aim is to empower homeowners with actionable recommendations, enebling them to make informed decisions about home renovation that have th potential to increase the value of their homes.\n",
    "## Defining the metrics for success\n",
    "The project would be considered a success if:\n",
    "- The predictive model achieves an R-Squared value of at least 80%. This indicates that the model can explain a significant portion of the variation in the estimated home values based on the selected feature.\n",
    "- The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the model is less than or equal to 10%. MAPE measures the average percentage difference between the predicted and actual values. A MAPE of 10% or lower indicates that on average, the model's predictions deviate by no more than 10% from the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Design\n",
    "1. Data Collection. Here we will describe how the King County Sales dataset was obtained and any data preprocessing steps that were performed such as handling missing values, data cleaning and feature selection.\n",
    "2. Exploratory Data Analysis. Here we will summarize the initial exploration and visualization of the dataset to gain insights intothe distribution of variables, identify any outliers and understand the relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
    "3. Feature Engineering. Here we will detail the steps taken to transform or engineer the features, such as scling, creating interactio terms, or encoding categorical variables. Explain the rationale behid these transformations and how they contribute to improving the regression model.\n",
    "4. Model Building. Here we will outline the process of building the multiple linear regression model by selecting the relevant features, splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the model to the training data, and evaluating the model's performance using appropriate validation techniques.\n",
    "5. Model Evaluation. Here we will present the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, such as R-Squared, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. Discuss the model's performance against the predefined success metrics and analyze the strengths and limitations of the model.\n",
    "6. Model Improvement. Here we will descibe any iteration or improvements made to the initial model based on the evaluation results. This may involve feature selection, feature engineering, regularization techniques, or trying alternative regression models to enhance the models performance.\n",
    "7. Interpretaion of Coefficients. Here we will discuss the interpretation of the regression coefficients and their significance in relation to the target variable. Explain how these coefficients provide insights into the impact of different features on the estimated home value.\n",
    "8. Conclusion. Here we will summarize the findings from the analysis, including the final regression model's performance, the key factors influencing home value, and any actionable recommendations for homeowners based on the model's insights.\n",
